# Informational website

This is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) Curriculum. I took it a bit further by doing some research of my own and implementing some other stuff besides the requierments. [The net ninja](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheNetNinja) was a great help, some of the code here is inspired by his Nodejs tutorial.

## What I've learned

- Basic Nodejs file sistem, routing and servers
- Requests and Responses
- How to work with express
- The ejs view engine, which enables server side rendering
- ejs partial templates
